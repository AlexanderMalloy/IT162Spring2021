<p>When creating a website for a business, the choice of online shopping cart is an important one. The most important interaction on a sales site is the one where the customer actually commits to paying money for a good or service. “A good shopping cart is not a luxury nowadays, but a necessity for those who want to sell products or services,” writes Dinarys.com. A highly functional and easy to use shopping cart is critical to ensuring the customer completes the experience all the way to payment.
<br><br>There is a wide array of options for creating an online shopping experience on a website. As will all other aspects of creating a commerce site, or really any public facing website, the user experience is one important factor. However, there are also other facets to consider as well. <br>
One such consideration is whether to use a turn-key hosted cart system or a bespoke created one. Setting aside for the moment the actual hosting and operation of the cart, whether to have a shopping cart created custom for the website as opposed to a plug and play option is its own decision. For smaller websites, it might just not be a worthwhile expenditure to have a custom created creation when a hosted one will do the job just as well and can be modified to fit the design scheme.
<br><br>Another factor is the actual hosting and cost. There are two costs associated with hosted online shopping carts: the cost of actually running the cart, and the cost of the monetary transactions. These are usually performed by a separate company through arrangement with the cart company and have their own costs. Juan Martinez and Jeffrey L Wilson at PCMag.com write, “Think carefully about what you want from your store to determine if bandwidth limits or transaction fees make sense for you.”
<br><br>In the end, for a lot of smaller online retail owners, a hosted solution makes the most sense. As bigcommerce.com puts it, it’s “not to say all new online retail store owners aren't adept in IT, but a hosted solution may free up time to focus on other aspects of operations.”
